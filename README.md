## Experience and Lessons Learnt

- Building a Social Media: Learned all the components and essentials that make up every social media platform and how to connect everything effectively.
- AJAX Integration: Implemented real-time comment posting to improve user experience without full page reloads. This is tricky but provides the user a more seamless experience.
- UI Design: Experimented frequently with different layouts and tools to try and find the best and most appealing designs for the web app and accessibility too
- Full Stack Web App Workflow: Used Laravel, Blade templates, Models, Views, Controllers and Relationships. This was my first ever experience at a full stack project working simultaneously with the front end and back end to work together seamlessly but I see it is dificult and will be better next time
